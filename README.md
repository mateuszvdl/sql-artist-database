# SQL Artists Database Project

This repository contains a simple university project focused on the fundamentals of SQL. It includes the necessary scripts to create and populate a small database of musical artists and their album sales.

## About The Project

This project was created to practice basic and intermediate SQL commands, including:
* Creating tables (`CREATE TABLE`) with primary and foreign keys.
* Inserting data (`INSERT INTO`).
* Querying data with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY`.
* Joining tables using `LEFT JOIN`.
* Aggregating data with `SUM()` and `GROUP BY`.

The main goal is to demonstrate how to structure a relational database and retrieve meaningful information from it.

## How to Use

The database file (`.db`) is not tracked in this repository, which is standard practice. To recreate the database locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/sql-artists-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/sql-artists-project.git)
    ```

2.  **Create the database:**
    * Using a tool like DB Browser for SQLite, create a new, empty database file (e.g., `Artists.db`).
    * Run the `schema.sql` script to create the tables.
    * Run the `data.sql` script to populate the tables with the initial data.

You will now have a complete, working copy of the database.
